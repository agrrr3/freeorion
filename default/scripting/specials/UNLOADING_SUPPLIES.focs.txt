Special
    // redundant code : https://github.com/freeorion/freeorion/blob/master/universe/Ship.cpp#L727
    // meters should become OO with two types (simple and paired)
	// dont understand how not generic part meters are added (https://github.com/freeorion/freeorion/blob/master/universe/Ship.cpp#L81)
    // Idea: a special is a good place for bookkeeping,
    //    1) it is not accessible to user interaction (cant be removed at will like a building)
    //    2) it is one-to-one to a planet
    //  a special has the following properties:	
    //     capacity = <<DOUBLE>>
    //     <<CONDITION>>: HasSpecialCapacity name = <<STRING>> low = <<DOUBLE>> high = <<DOUBLE>>
    //     <<CONDITION>>: SetSpecialCapacity name = <<STRING>> capacity = <<FLOAT>>   // will also change HasSpecialSinceTurn
    //     <<CONDITION>>: HasSpecialSinceTurn name = "" 
    //     EFFECT AddSpecial name = <<STRING>> capacity = 0.0f
    //     EFFECT RemoveSpecial
    //     ??ThisSpecial??
    //  ... I don't think there's actually a way to get the value of a particular part's capacity or max capacity on a particular ship to use in a calculation (eg. multiplying it by something and adding something).
    //  ... a ship part is not an object itself
    //     <<CONDITION>> Source.ShipPartMeter part = <<STRING>> Capacity low = <<DOUBLE>> high = <<DOUBLE>>
    //     ship meters:
    //       "paired meters" refers to meters which have a max meter as well
    //       a meter is identified by a pair: its type METER_CAPACITY/METER_MAX_CAPACITY/METER_SECONDARY_STAT/METER_MAX_SECONDARY_STAT and a name
    //       https://github.com/freeorion/freeorion/blob/master/universe/Ship.cpp#L75
    //  so this doesnt work: activation = (Source.Age >= 10)
    // this should (HasSpecialSinceTurn)  > 1 )
    // https://github.com/freeorion/freeorion/blob/master/universe/UniverseObject.h (AddSpecial, RemoveSpecial, SetSpecialCapacity, HasSpecial, SpecialCapacity, SpecialAddedOnTurn)

    // hmmmm, but there is a present-since attribute...
