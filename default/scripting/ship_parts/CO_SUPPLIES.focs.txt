    //  Implementation notes: chooses randomly one of the eligible planets to unload. Better would be to evenly distribute the supplies; complicated; not worth it.
    //  Part which unloads and scraps the ship at planets with BLD_UNLOAD_SUPPLY
    //  Given a ship with a ship part CO_SUPPLIES_030
    //  orGiven two ships with a ship part CO_SUPPLIES_030
    //  orGiven a ship with two (or many) ship parts CO_SUPPLIES_030
    //  when entering a system with a planet with BLD_UNLOAD_SUPPLY	
    //  orWhen staying in a system with a planet with BLD_UNLOAD_SUPPLY	
    //  orWhen entering a system with two (or many) planets with BLD_UNLOAD_SUPPLY	
    //  then it is scrapped
    //  Given a ship with a ship part CO_SUPPLIES_030
    //  when entering a system without a planet with BLD_UNLOAD_SUPPLY
