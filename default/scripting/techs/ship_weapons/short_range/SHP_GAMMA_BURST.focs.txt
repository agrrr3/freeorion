// In absense of shields this weapon can get almost as good as Plasma. Against shields its pretty useless
// BURST_1   12RP  3T  allow 40PP part unlock with 3 shots with 3 damage - almost comparable damage to two MD_3 at the same PP cost and 20% more RP cost, but better upgrades
// BURST_2   10RP  3T  upgrade to 3 shots with 4 damage - comparable damage to two MD_4 at the same PP cost but double the shots
// BURST_3   50RP  3T  upgrade to 3 shots with 5 damage - comparable damage to one point three L_4 or one P_3; comparable to one and half L_2 against shields-3
// BAD_ AVERAGE_ GOOD_ GREAT_ PILOT -1 +0 +1 +2 damage
// Weapon seems like a good choice to support invasion

// Maybe we should add a MD_5 at 100RP (which would total damage at 7)

// It should be able to support MD invasion - should at least double the shots at the same price point(?).
// With at least 4 shots increasing damage is probably usually OP (its like a level of death ray)
// Increasing shots with steady 3 damage is plasma gun level.
// Probably comsat should go down to 2 structure again. That would make this easier:
// Then increasing _number_of_shots_ with steady 2 damage would be acceptable laser weapon level.
